## Primary buttons
Primary buttons should be used for the primary task of the page.  

### Example

## Secondary buttons
Subordinate to primary, secondary buttons have less visual contrast against the page. Secondary actions tend to be less utilized and are often counter to the primary button action (e.g. declining or abandoning a process).

## Log In button
Used exclusively in login widgets, pages or modals to submit user credentials. When located in the masthead, the “Log In” button can also expand or navigate a user to a standalone page. Once in an authenticated space, users may be presented with a “Log Out” button in the same style. Note teal color restrictions

## Outlined buttons
Used as a call to action (CTA) or as alternate to a primary button when one is already in use.

Disabled buttons are not required to be contrast complainant since they are not functional elements.

Link text should clearly explain the destination or purpose of the link to accommodate screen reader users. Avoid ambiguous link text like “read more”.
